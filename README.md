# Online CLI

I really like CLIs, so I decided to create my own online CLI.  

## Random Music
This CLI contains commands to random musics on music platforms, but if you prefer, you access the links directly:
Try it: https://lucaohost.github.io/random/music/  

Short URLs:
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmy
  - Random Music on Youtube
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rms
  - Random Music on Spotify
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmym
  - Random Music on Youtube Music
- https://lucaohost.github.io/
- https://lucaohost.github.io/random/music

Perfect to put in the bookmarks bar.
