# Online CLI

I really like CLIs, so I decided to create my own online CLI.

## Random Music
This CLI contains commands to random musics, but if you prefer, you can access the links directly:
Try it: https://lucaohost.github.io/random/music/  

Short URLs:
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmy
  - Random Music on YouTube
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rms
  - Random Music on Spotify
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmym
  - Random Music on YouTube Music

Perfect for placing in the bookmarks bar.

# How to Run
- Open the project on VSCode;
- Right button on index.html;
- Click the option "Open with Live Server";
- Access the locally on http://localhost:5500/ on browser;
- Maybe it will be necessary some VSCode extension, I don't remember.
