# Online CLI

I really like CLIs, so I decided to create my own online CLI.  

## Random Music
This CLI contains commands to random musics, but if you prefer, you can access the links directly:
Try it: https://lucaohost.github.io/random/music/  

Short URLs:
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmy
  - Random Music on YouTube
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rms
  - Random Music on Spotify
- https://lucaohost.github.io/rmym
  - Random Music on YouTube Music

Perfect for placing in the bookmarks bar.
